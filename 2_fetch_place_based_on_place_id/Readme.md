To modify the code to return a **formatted address** broken down into its components such as **street**, **city**, **state**, **zip code**, and **country**, you can leverage the **address_components** field in the Google Places API response. This field contains an array of address components, each with a `long_name`, `short_name`, and `types`. By iterating over these components, you can extract and categorize them.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the code to extract those components:

### Modified Python Code:
```python
import requests
import json

# Your Google Places API key
API_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY'

# Base URL for the Google Places API Place Details endpoint
PLACE_DETAILS_URL = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json'

# Function to get place details by place_id
def get_place_details(place_id):
    # Construct the request URL with the place_id and API key
    params = {
        'place_id': place_id,
        'key': API_KEY
    }
    
    # Send the GET request to the Google Places API
    response = requests.get(PLACE_DETAILS_URL, params=params)
    
    # Check if the response was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        
        # Check if the results are found
        if data.get('status') == 'OK':
            return data['result']  # Returns the place details
        else:
            print("Error:", data.get('status'), data.get('error_message', 'No error message'))
    else:
        print("Failed to fetch data. HTTP Status code:", response.status_code)

    return None

# Function to extract address components
def extract_address_components(address_components):
    street = city = state = zip_code = country = None
    
    for component in address_components:
        types = component.get('types', [])
        long_name = component.get('long_name', '')
        
        if 'street_number' in types:
            street = long_name
        elif 'route' in types:
            street = f"{street} {long_name}" if street else long_name
        elif 'locality' in types:
            city = long_name
        elif 'administrative_area_level_1' in types:
            state = long_name
        elif 'postal_code' in types:
            zip_code = long_name
        elif 'country' in types:
            country = long_name
            
    return street, city, state, zip_code, country

# Example usage
place_id = 'ChIJu3uL1VKe5kcRw62oRyx7rw0'  # Replace with your own place_id
place_details = get_place_details(place_id)

if place_details:
    print("full response")
    print(json.dumps(place_details, indent=4))
    
    # Extract the formatted address and components
    formatted_address = place_details.get('formatted_address', 'No address available')
    address_components = place_details.get('address_components', [])
    
    street, city, state, zip_code, country = extract_address_components(address_components)
    
    print("Formatted Address:", formatted_address)
    print("Street:", street if street else "Not available")
    print("City:", city if city else "Not available")
    print("State:", state if state else "Not available")
    print("Zip Code:", zip_code if zip_code else "Not available")
    print("Country:", country if country else "Not available")
```

### Explanation:

1. **API Request**:
   - The function `get_place_details` sends a request to the Google Places API's `details` endpoint to retrieve the details of the place identified by the `place_id`.

2. **Address Components**:
   - The Google Places API returns an array of `address_components` in the place details response. Each component includes information like the name (`long_name`), the short name (`short_name`), and the type of component (e.g., street, locality, country, etc.).
   
3. **Extracting Address Components**:
   - The function `extract_address_components` loops through the `address_components` array and looks for specific types such as `street_number`, `route` (for street), `locality` (for city), `administrative_area_level_1` (for state), `postal_code` (for zip code), and `country`.
   - It then returns the individual address elements (street, city, state, zip code, country).

4. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - If the component is missing, the variables (street, city, state, zip_code, country) will default to `None`. In the output, this will be handled by checking if each component is present before printing it. If any component is missing, the message "Not available" will be shown.

### Sample Output:

Assuming the `place_id` corresponds to the **Googleplex**, the output would look something like this:

```
Formatted Address: 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
Street: 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
City: Mountain View
State: California
Zip Code: 94043
Country: United States
```

### Notes:
- The `address_components` array can contain more or fewer components, depending on the complexity of the address.
- Some places may not include certain components, such as `street_number` or `route`, depending on the data available.
- The address components might appear in a different order, but the function looks for the specific type of component, so it will always correctly assign the values (even if the order changes).
